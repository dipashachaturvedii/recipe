- `scrapers/`: Contains the main scraping logic and utility functions.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `scrapers` package.
  - `main.py`: Entry point of the scraper application.
  - `scraper.py`: Module containing the scraping functions.
  - `data_processing.py`: Module for data processing and manipulation.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions used in the scraper.
- `tests/`: Directory for tests.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `tests` package.
  - `test_scraper.py`: Test cases for the scraper functions.
- `data/`: Directory for data-related modules and files.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `data` package.
  - `storage.py`: Module for data storage and retrieval.
- `config/`: Directory for configuration files.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `config` package.
  - `settings.py`: Configuration settings for the scraper.
- `datasets/`: Directory for storing the scraped data.
  - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `datasets` package.
- `Dockerfile`: Docker configuration file for containerization.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project and instructions for setup and usage.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dipashachaturvedii/recipe.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the scraper, execute the following command:

```bash
python scrapers/main.py
```

This will initiate the scraping process and store the scraped data in the `datasets/` directory.

## Running Tests

To run the test cases, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Adding Tests

To add additional tests, create new Python files in the `tests` directory that follow the naming convention `test_*.py`. Within these files, write test cases using a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`.

Feel free to update the content based on your specific testing setup and requirements.

## Docker

The project also provides a Dockerfile for containerization. You can build a Docker image using the following command:

```bash
docker build -t myrecipe:v2 .
```

To run the Docker container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --name myrec -it --rm myrecipe:v2
```
